Human pose estimation is done as classification task

210 epochs for training on mpii

swin-base -> image 256*256

Mistakes made in stage 1
- Didn't implement occlusion handiling in MPIIDataset class
- Didn't use EMA in vector quantizer instead i used MSE.
- training Stage 1 isolated not sure how to proceed to stage 2 fuck but ill figure it out.
- some joints are randomly masked in stage 1 to improve generalizability
